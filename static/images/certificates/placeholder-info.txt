Certificate Image Placeholders

This folder will store certificate images for the portfolio.

For now, the website is using URL-based placeholder images:
- https://via.placeholder.com/800x600?text=Certificate+Name

Current placeholder files:
- mission-chandra-1.jpg (Competition Certificate)
- mission-chandra-2.jpg (Award Ceremony)
- science-fair-2024.jpg (Science Fair 2024 Project)
- science-fair-2025.jpg (Science Fair 2025 Project)
- xenesis-community-1.jpg (Stage Community Head 2023)
- xenesis-community-2.jpg (Stage Community Head 2024)
- xenesis-coordinator.jpg (Event Coordinator Certificate)

To use your actual certificates:
1. Save your certificate images in this folder with the same names as the placeholders
2. The images should be high-resolution but keep file size reasonable (compress if needed)
3. Recommended aspect ratio: 4:3 or 16:9 for consistent display

Example path to use in the HTML:
/static/images/certificates/your-certificate.jpg
